By fourth-grade son built an end table for me last week. He surprised me with it. I
think it was very sweet of him to bald it for me. It is the most elegant little table I had
ever own. I moved one of my other table out of the living room and replaced it with
new one. By daughter commented that it didn’t match the furniture in the living
room, but it looked fine for me. By neighbor mentioned that one of the legs of the
table was a little bit shorter than the other legs, but it looked great to me. By sister
remarked that there was a nail sticking out of the side of the table because it looked
okay to me I know the table has some imperfections, but my fourth-grade son built it,
and it looks perfect to me.
